In the **Video project**, we will focus on integrating video playback functionality within an HTML structure. Key aspects include:

### Project Features:
1. **Video Integration**:
   - Adding video content to the webpage while ensuring readability with white text.

2. **Darker Overlay**:
   - To improve contrast, a darker overlay will be applied over the video. This may hinder access to the default video controls.

3. **Custom Video Controls**:
   - To manage play and pause functionality, JavaScript will be used to create custom buttons, as the overlay will prevent users from using the standard controls.

4. **Preloader Implementation**:
   - A preloader will be introduced to enhance user experience while the video is loading. This feature is particularly useful for larger video files.
   - The preloader concept can be adapted for other projects, not just videos.

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Demonstrations will include observing the preloader effect by simulating slower network speeds.
